! NOTES

This is a custom data format (jogu data) for a text adventure game/interactive fiction, which is designed to be easily human writeable, the focus being on ease-of-use from a mobile device.

It is processed by the associated RFO Basic file "load_jogu_data.bas", the game mechanics and main loop being in the file "jogu_adventure.bas".

The idea is to change and add to the locations and descriptions below, in order to create your own world.

Happy writing!

###

Formatting rules:
* any text before "### START" or after "### END" is ignored.
* records are separated by a "#" character on its own line
* there are two types of record:
    * building records, which are applied to all records following them until the next building record
    * location records
* records consist of one or more lines of the format "key: value"
* building records consist of a single "building" key, a colon (:) and the name of the building
* location records consist of these keys, followed by a colon (:) and a value
    * loc: human readable name of location
    * desc: description of location
    * exits: special format described below
* exit values are a comma separated list of exit names and location names joined by an equals sign (=)
    * valid exit names are uppercase: N, E, S, W, NE, SE, SW, NW (representing compass points as is traditional)
    * valid location names are exact matches for "loc" values (case sensitive)
* no line-breaks are allowed within each key-value line.
* The first location record found in the data file will be the starting location.
* TO DO: More than one building
